Welcome to **Face Mask Detection Project**!
It uses computer vision to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The system is built using Python and OpenCV.

## Introduction

This project starts at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is an innovative solution that aims
to reduce the cost and enhance the efficiency of COVID-19 testing. By using computer vision and deep learning model,
the system can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This can be used in a variety of settings,
such as schools, hospitals, and public spaces, to ensure that people are following the guidelines for wearing masks.
Although the pandemic is slowing down, it is a valuable project to demostrate and may be used in future.

## Framework

1. Train the model using CNN.
2. Use face detection model `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` to detect faces.
3. Input faces into the model.
